leading Dam construction ?
	Until the 1990s, the World Bank was heavily involved in supporting dam construction projects.

However, public pressure and mounting controversies surrounding some high profile dam-building projects led to increasing concerns. In 1993, it withdrew funding from a multi-million dollar project along the Narmada river in India.

 

The Bank, “once the biggest force behind big dams”, had “grown skittish”, said the Economist.

A report by the World Commission on Dams in 2000, commissioned by the World Bank, highlighted the social and environmental damage that was being caused by large dams.

 

With the World Bank turning away from the sector, China has filled the gap and now dominates the industry. Since the turn of the century, China has accounted for over half of worldwide hydropower growth, according to the IHA. It has capacity to produce twice as much as the US.

 

And China not only became the largest producer, it also started taking its business abroad.

Chinese construction companies and financiers were encouraged to go global as part of the government’s attempt to do more business overseas. This is why many experts believe that Chinese companies now control at least half of the hydropower dam-building market worldwide.
