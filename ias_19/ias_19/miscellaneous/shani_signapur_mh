For years, Shani Shingnapur had no police station, as there was no need for one. It was only in 2015 that the police station of a nearby village was shifted to Shani Shingnapur to control the surge in the number of pilgrims during peak season. Until 2010, there were no known instances of theft or burglary, but recently, a few complaints – such as small amounts of stolen cash, jewellery and other items – have been registered. A police official stated that small incidents sometimes go unreported as the economy of the village is centred on the temple, and such reports can tarnish its reputation and traditions. He added that some pilgrims who come to pray in the temple commit petty crimes like pickpocketing or vehicle thefts in the surrounding areas. Still, villagers refuse to keep their valuables under lock and key as their faith in Lord Shani remains absolute.

 

Although no-one wants to openly address the issue, it is evident that a few residents have started using wooden sliding doors, plywood planks or even latches to safeguard their homes. Adjacent villages have had several instances of robbery, and it seems that some residents prefer to be safe than sorry.
