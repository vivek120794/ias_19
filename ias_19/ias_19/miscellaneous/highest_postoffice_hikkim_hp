Postmaster Rinchen Chhering has been running the operations since its inception in 1983. Itâ€™s difficult work: few motorable roads means the mail must be carried on foot, and the post office is often forced to shut during winter months due to heavy snowfall.

 

Two postmen make the arduous 46km round-trip journey on foot each day across high mountain passes and rolling pastures to deliver mail to Kaza, the capital of the Spiti Valley, which is connected by road to other larger towns in the state of Himachal Pradesh. From Kaza, the outbound mail is dispatched via buses along often treacherous mountain roads, while inbound letters are carried back on foot to Hikkim.
