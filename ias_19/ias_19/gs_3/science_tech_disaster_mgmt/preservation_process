Britannica: The term hide is used to designate the skin of larger animals (e.g., cowhide or horsehide), whereas skin refers to that of smaller animals (e.g., calfskin or kidskin). The preservation process employed is a chemical treatment called tanning, which converts the otherwise perishable skin to a stable and nondecaying material. Tanning agents include vegetable tannins (from sources such as tree bark), mineral salts (such as chromium sulfate – as much as 85% of the world’s leather production is chrome-tanned using Chromium III salt) and fish or animal oils.
