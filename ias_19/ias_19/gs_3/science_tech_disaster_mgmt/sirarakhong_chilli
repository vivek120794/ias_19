Since 2009, the Sirarakhong village in Manipurâ€™s Ukhrul district has celebrated the Hatei Phanit festival, dedicated to its indigenous, organically-grown chilli called the Sirarakhong, which is slowly gaining popularity for its distinct taste.

 

More importantly, however, the Sirarakhong is a source of economic sustenance for the remote Manipuri village. The chillies grow over eight inches in length and are calcium-rich apart from possessing a high Vitamin C content which makes them a fantastic source of nutrients and antioxidants. Their stark red colour is a result of high carotene levelS.

 

The State Horticultural Department is planning to lobby for the chilli to obtain a GI tag.
