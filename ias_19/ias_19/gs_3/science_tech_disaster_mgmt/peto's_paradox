If every cell has an equal chance of going cancerous, elephants which have many billions of cells in their bodies would be expected to have greater chances of getting cancer than us humans. But it turns out that elephants (with a typical body mass of around 4,800 kg) are found to have a cancer rate of 5–8%, compared to 11–25% in us humans. This is also true of whales (40,000 kg); they seldom get cancer. And the 600 kg manatees, also called sea ‘cows’ (because they are vegetarians, and live on water plants in tropical seas) too seldom get cancer. On the other hand, a mouse, which hardly weighs a few grams, is 3 times more likely to get cancer than us humans. Thus, there seems more an inverse correlation between body mass and cancer probability. This inverse relationship was first noticed by Dr. Richard Peto of Oxford University about 70 years ago, and has come to be known as Peto’s Paradox.
