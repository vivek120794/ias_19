ISROSENE
	ISRO has already begun the move towards environment-friendly and green propellants with the acceptance of Liquid Oxygen (LOX)/Liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and LOX/Kerosene based propulsion systems for launch vehicles, and use of electric propulsion for spacecraft. The LOX/LH2 combination is already being used in the cryogenic upper stages of GSLV and GSLV Mk-III launch vehicles. ISRO has successfully developed ISROSENE, which is a rocket grade version of kerosene as an alternative to conventional hydrazine rocket fuel.
