Other than Crops For the Future (CFF), which bills itself as the world’s first research centre dedicated solely to underutilised crops, there are other key groups championing agricultural diversity including Crop Trust, Slow Food, Icrisat and Bioversity International. Add to that more middle-income consumers searching for nutritious foods and others eager to try the unprocessed foods their grandparents once ate. There is a growing global momentum around forgotten foods.

 

Crops which have been farmed for centuries but are virtually unknown outside the places where they grow are known as forgotten crops (or orphan crops, or simple ‘under-used’ or ‘alternative’ crops). By investing in neglected local plants, countries can reduce their reliance on imported crops and their carbon-heavy supply chains. Reclaiming the variety of crops humans once ate also boosts food security at a time warming climates threaten existing crops.

these are - wheat, rice and maize,soyabean,Potatoes, Sweet potatoes, Cassava, sorghum, plantains and yam.
