found at cartagena coast in carebian sea.
Cartagena is a port city on Colombia’s Caribbean coast.

The Varadero reef, located in Cartagena Bay, has survived against the odds to thrive in a highly polluted environment. The Caribbean Sea bay, a major waterway for shipping vessels and cruise ships, is contaminated by industrial and sewage waste. According to marine biologists, the reef should not be alive, and yet it has flourished, providing a home to a large number of coral, fish and urchin species.

 

Current plans to dredge part of Varadero … could hinder researchers’ ability to gain insight into the factors that have allowed corals to thrive under such unusual conditions. With further study, scientists hope the enigmatic reef could provide clues to recovering the world’s bleached and dying corals.
