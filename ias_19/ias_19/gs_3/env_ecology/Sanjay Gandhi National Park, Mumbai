Sanjay Gandhi National Park, Mumbai
	Mumbai is home to the highest concentration of leopards anywhere in the world. They capitalise on hunting the animals that man brings into the city.

An estimated 35 to 41 leopards live in this National Park. As leopard habitats shrink and they move into the city to survive, some communities are afraid to leave their houses. Children in affected areas must walk around in groups of six or more. However, a recent study suggested that the leopards may be protecting their human neighbours from rabies. Around 40 per cent of the leopardsâ€™ diet is feral dogs, which is the main source of the deadly virus.
