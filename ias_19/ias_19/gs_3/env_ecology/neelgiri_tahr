The present distribution of the Nilgiri tahr (endangered) is limited to approximately 5% of the Western Ghats in southern India, in Kerala and Tamil Nadu in southern India, although not along the border between these two states. At the beginning of this century the range of tahr probably extended northward at least to the Brahmagiri hills of southern Karnataka. The animals are more or less confined to altitudes of 1,200 to 2,600 meters.
