Promisingly, we have a historic opportunity to stop the African elephant poaching crisis: China has taken the remarkable step of closing its legal domestic ivory market at the end of 2017; Hong Kong has also agreed to a market closure by 2021.

 

China’s ivory ban is a historic milestone in the ongoing effort to save an iconic species. But as China’s markets close, markets elsewhere remain open and continue to attract consumers. And as more and more Chinese travel internationally—nearly 200 million Chinese tourists travel abroad each year—incidents of ivory smuggling are on the rise. This access to ivory outside China could seriously undermine the effectiveness of China’s 2017 ivory ban unless we address it. Closing the most troublesome legal and illegal markets that largely exist to serve Chinese nationals—those in Thailand, Myanmar, Vietnam, and Laos, for example—will help dry up demand.
