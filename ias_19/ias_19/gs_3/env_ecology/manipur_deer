 Inbreeding depression is the reduced biological fitness in a given population as a result of inbreeding, or breeding of related individuals. Population biological fitness refers to an organism’s ability to survive and perpetuate its genetic material. Inbreeding depression is often the result of a population bottleneck.

 

WWF: Sangai faces threat from steadily degenerating habitat of phumdi as a result of continuous inundation and flooding caused due to artificial reservoir. Water quality of the reservoir is degrading due to pollution and stoppage of nutrient supply. There is also invasion of non-native plants like Paragrass. There has been decrease in area of phumdi from 31.60 km2 in 1993 to 23.72 km2 in 2010.
