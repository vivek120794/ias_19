public credit registry
	A comprehensive credit information repository covering all types of credit facilities (funded and non-funded) extended by all credit institutions – Commercial Banks, Cooperative Banks, NBFCs, MFIs – and also covering borrowings from other sources, including external commercial borrowings and borrowing from market, is essential to ascertain the total indebtedness of a legal or natural person. With technology acting as an enabler, this repository can make near real time monitoring of credit risk possible and also address legitimate privacy concerns of the borrowers by making all access to a borrower’s information contained in the repository dependent on the borrower’s consent.

 

By having a registry of all loans in the form of a PCR, and recording all material events for each loan during its life cycle, the credit delivery system can be tuned more efficiently so that the populace not having access to formal credit, or with limited or no credit history, can be brought within its ambit. The resulting increase in credit flow to the MSME sector and the underserved populace could propel the Indian economy to a higher growth path. With a PCR in place, and with full coverage of credit market ensured by mandatory reporting, the ease in getting credit and in turn the ranking of India in the World Bank’s ease of doing business index would also likely to be improved.
