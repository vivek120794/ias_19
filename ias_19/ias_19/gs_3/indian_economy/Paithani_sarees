	Yeola is one of Maharashtraâ€™s biggest handloom centres, known particularly for its richly motifed silk-and-gold Paithani saris
	part of a 200-year-old weaving tradition patronised by the Peshwas. The 2,300 looms in Yeola reportedly outnumber those in Paithan village, the birthplace of the Paithani sari.
