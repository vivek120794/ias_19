Sanskrit is not restricted to Hindu compositions. It has also been used by Jaina and Buddhist scholars, the latter primarily Mahāyāna Buddhists (who emerged in the post-mauryan phase, around the beginning of the Common Era).

 

Mattur (Karnataka) is one of the very few places in the India where residents still converse in the classical language of Sanskrit.
