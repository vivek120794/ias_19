Sangam Polity
• Hereditary monarchy was the form of government during the Sangam period.
• The king had also taken the advice of his minister, court-poet and the imperial court or avai.
• The Chera kings assumed titles like Vanavaramban, Vanavan, Kuttuvan, Irumporai and Villavar, the Chola kings like Senni, Valavan and Killi and the Pandya kings Thennavar and Minavar.
• Each of the Sangam dynasties had a royal emblem – carp for the Pandyas, tiger for the Cholas and bow for the Cheras.
• The imperial court or avai was attended by a number of chiefs and officials.
• The king was assisted by a large body of officials who were divided into five councils. They were ministers (amaichar), priests (anthanar), military commanders (senapathi), envoys (thuthar) and spies (orrar).
• The military administration was also efficiently organized during the Sangam Age and each ruler had a regular army and their respective Kodimaram (tutelary tree).
• Land revenue was the chief source of state’s income while custom duty was also imposed on foreign trade.
• The Pattinappalai refers to the custom officials employed in the seaport of Puhar.
• Booty captured in wars was also a major income to the royal treasury.
• Roads and highways were well maintained and guarded night and day to prevent robbery and smuggling.
