Mattur and its sister village, Hosahalli, are also known for their efforts to support the ancient tradition of gamaka, a unique form of singing and storytelling in Karnataka.

 

In gamaka, also known as “Kaavya Vaachana”, a gamaki (singer) reads a stanza of a poem with a high emphasis on meaning, in a raga (melody) that matches the emotion of the poem. Another person then explains the vyakyana or meaning of the stanza through examples and anecdotes. The ragas are drawn from traditional Kannada folk tunes and Carnatic music while the poems are mostly from old Kannada epics.
