Itmad-ud-Daulah (Ghiyas Beg) was Nur Jahan’s father.

 

Nur Jahan was a poet, an expert hunter and an innovative architect. Her design for her parents’ tomb in Agra later inspired the construction of the Taj Mahal.

 

Nur and Jahangir complemented each other, and the emperor never felt uncomfortable with his wife’s burgeoning influence as co-sovereign. Soon after their marriage, she issued her first royal order to protect the land rights of an employee. Her signature in the order read, Nur Jahan Padshah Begum, which translates as Nur Jahan, the Lady Emperor. It was a sign of sovereignty and an indication that her power was growing.

 

In 1617, gold and silver coins, which bore her name opposite that of Jahangir, started circulating. Court chroniclers, foreign diplomats, tradesmen and visitors soon started to note her unique status. One courtier described an incident where she surprised many by appearing in the imperial balcony, which was reserved for men only.
