The Idukki arch dam , 169 metres high, on the Periyar River, was completed in 1974. It connects two huge rocksâ€”Kurathi (925 metres) high, and Kuravan, (839 metres) high. Together with the Cheruthoni dam (1976), on the Cheruthoni River, and the Kulamavu dam (1977), on the Muvattu Puzha River, the Idukki dam forms a large reservoir. The dam is used primarily for flood control and to generate hydroelectric power.
