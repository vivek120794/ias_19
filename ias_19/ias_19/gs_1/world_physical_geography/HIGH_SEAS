HIGH SEAS
	The high seas are defined as the oceans that lie beyond exclusive economic zones. These zones (EEZs) are usually within 370km (200 nautical miles) of a country’s coastline. These waters (high seas) cover one and a half times the total land area of the planet and are home to some of the rarest and most charismatic species – but all countries have the right to navigate, fly over, carry our scientific research and fish on the high seas without restriction.
