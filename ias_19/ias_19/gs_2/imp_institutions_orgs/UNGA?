	In 2017 the General Assembly decided to establish a new process for the selection of the President of the General Assembly. The Assembly decided to conduct informal interactive dialogues with candidates for the position of President of the General Assembly, thus contributing to the transparency and inclusivity of the process. Furthermore, the General Assembly called upon candidates to present to the Assembly their vision statements.

 

In accordance with the rules of procedure, the Assembly shall elect a President and twenty-one Vice-Presidents at least three months before the opening of the session over which they are to preside. The election of the President of the 73rd session of the General Assembly took place in the General Assembly Hall at United Nations Headquarters in New York on Tuesday, 5 June 2018.
