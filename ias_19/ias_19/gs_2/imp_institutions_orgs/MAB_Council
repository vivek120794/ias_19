	international coordination council
	The MAB Council (or just ‘ICC’), consists of 34 Member States (there are way more states that have biosphere reserves declared under UNESCO’s MAB programme) elected by UNESCO’s biennial General Conference. In between meetings, the authority of the ICC is delegated to its Bureau, whose members are nominated from each of UNESCO’s geopolitical regions.
	MAB ICC also decides upon new biosphere reserves and takes note of recommendations on periodic review reports of biosphere reserves.
