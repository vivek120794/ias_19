Swachh Manch
	web-based platform which aims to bring together every stakeholder contributing to the Swachh Bharat Mission under a common platform
	The Swachh Manch will also be integrated with the existing Swachhata App to act as a citizens’ grievance redressal platform.

	The platform will allow stakeholders to create/invite/participate in volunteering opportunities around neighborhoods. Swachh Manch will enable uploads of pictorial evidence of citizens and organizations participating in the initiatives, as well as record the number of hours volunteered, as acknowledgement of citizens’/organisations’ efforts and contributions to the cause of ‘swachhata’.
