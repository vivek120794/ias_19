MPLADS
	In 1993-94, when the Scheme was launched, an amount of Rs. 5 lakh per Member of Parliament was allotted which became Rupees one crore per annum per MP constituency from 1994-95. This was stepped up to Rs. 2 crore from 1998-99 and now it is Rs.5 crore from the financial year 2011-12.
	Lok Sabha Members can recommend works within their Constituencies and Elected Members of Rajya Sabha can recommend works within the State of Election.
	Nominated Members of both the Rajya Sabha and Lok Sabha can recommend works anywhere in the country.
	In the event of “Calamity of severe nature” in any part of the country, an MP can recommend works up to a maximum of Rs.1 crore for the affected district.
	If an elected Member of Parliament finds the need to contribute MPLADS funds to a place outside that State/UT, or outside the constituency within the State, or both, the MP can recommend eligible works under these Guidelines up to a maximum of Rs. 25 lakh in a financial year. Such a gesture on the part of an MP will promote national unity, harmony, and fraternity among the people at the grassroots level.
