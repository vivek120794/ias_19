	“Because the deal does not define the Caspian as a lake, Iran – which has the smallest coastline – is viewed as a potential loser..”

	 

	Iran has a coastline that measures approximately 400 miles in length, whereas Azerbaijan’s coastline measures approximately 443 miles.

	In a landmark deal that has been more than two decades in the making, Russia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan – all bordering the Caspian Sea – have agreed in principle on how to divide it (the Caspian) up. Until 1991, the Caspian was known as a lake. But the dissolution of the USSR complicated this issue. Iran had argued it was a lake and not a sea, but none of the other four littoral states agreed.
