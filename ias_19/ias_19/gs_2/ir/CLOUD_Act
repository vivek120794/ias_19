CLOUD Act
	The Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act), will enable the U.S. government to enter into executive agreements with like-minded states for cross-border data sharing. This will allow law enforcement agencies only from these states to directly obtain electronic data, held by communication service providers headquartered in the U.S., to combat crime.
