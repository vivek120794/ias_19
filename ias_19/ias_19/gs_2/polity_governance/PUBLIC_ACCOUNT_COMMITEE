PUBLIC ACCOUNT COMMITEE
This committee was setup first in 1921 under the provisions of the Government of India Act of 1919 and has since been in existence. At present, it consists of 22 members (15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from  the  Rajya  Sabha).  The  members  are  elected  by  the  Parliament  every  year  from  amongst  its members according to the principle of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote.  Thus,  all  parties  get  due  representation  in  it.  The  term  of  office  of  the  members  is  one  year. A minister cannot be elected as a member of the committee. The chairman of the committee is appointed by the Speaker from amongst its members. Until 1966â€“67, the chairman of the committee belonged to the  ruling  party.  However,  since  1967  a  convention  has  developed  whereby  the  chairman  of  the committee is selected invariably from the Opposition.
