minerva mills case,1980
	the  Supreme  Court  held  that  ‘the  Indian  Constitution  is founded on the bedrock of the balance between the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles. They  together  constitute  the  core  of  commitment  to  social  revolution.  They  are  like  two  wheels  of  a chariot,  one  no  less  than  the  other.  To  give  absolute  primacy  to  one  over  the  other  is  to  disturb  the harmony of the Constitution. This harmony and balance between the two is an essential feature of the basic structure of the Constitution. The goals set out by the Directive Principles have to be achieved without the abrogation of the means provided by the Fundamental Rights’.

 

The  present  position  is  that  the  Fundamental  Rights  enjoy  supremacy  over  the  Directive Principles.  Yet,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  Directive  Principles  cannot  be  implemented.  The Parliament  can  amend  the  Fundamental  Rights  for  implementing  the  Directive  Principles,  so  long  as the amendment does not damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution.
