presiding officers of Rajya Sabha
	The Deputy  Chairman  performs the duties of the Chairman’s office when it is vacant or when the Vice-President  acts  as  President  or  discharges  the  functions  of  the  President.  He  also  acts  as  the Chairman  when  the  latter  is  absent  from  the  sitting  of  the  House.  In  both  the  cases,  he  has  all  the powers of the Chairman.

 

Under the Rules of Rajya Sabha, the Chairman nominates from amongst the members a panel of vice- chairpersons.  Any  one  of  them  can  preside  over  the  House  in  the  absence  of  the  Chairman  or  the Deputy Chairman. He has the same powers as the Chairman when so presiding. He holds office until a new panel of vice-chairpersons is nominated.  It  must  be  emphasised  here  that  a  member  of  the  panel  of  vice-chairpersons  cannot  preside  over  the House,  when  the  office  of  the  Chairman  or  the  Deputy  Chairman  is  vacant.  During  such  time,  the Chairman’s duties are to be performed by such member of the House as the president may appoint for the purpose. The elections are held, as soon as possible, to fill the vacant posts.
