In  1974, Sikkim  expressed  its  desire  for  greater  association  with  India. Accordingly,  the  35 th  Constitutional Amendment Act  (1974)  was  enacted  by  the  parliament.  This  amendment  introduced  a  new  class  of statehood under the constitution by conferring on Sikkim the status of an ‘associate state’ of the Indian Union. For this purpose, a new Article 2A and a new schedule (Tenth Schedule conseriving the terms and  conditions  of  association)  were  inserted  in  the  Constitution.
