Rohingya
	The Union Home Ministry has sent an advisory to State governments to enumerate, observe and collect biometric data of Rohingya migrants living in India, and told the Lok Sabha that the government had received reports of their involvement in illegal activities. The government also made it clear that Rohingyas were “illegal migrants” and not “refugees.” The 40,000 or so Rohingya in India were mostly found in Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad (Telangana), Mewat in Haryana and Tripura.
